# ‚òÇÔ∏è middleware

Middleware runs by-default on [Umbrel OS](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os) as a containerized service. It wraps [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin)'s RPC and [LND](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd)'s gRPC, and exposes them via a RESTful API.

Umbrel OS's [web dashboard](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-dashboard) uses middleware to interact with both Bitcoin and Lightning Network.

## üöÄ Getting started

If you are looking to run Umbrel on your hardware, you do not need to run this service on it's own. Just download [Umbrel OS](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os/releases) and you're good to go.

## üõ† Running middleware

Make sure a [`bitcoind`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) and [`lnd`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) instance is running and available on the same machine.

### Step 1. Install dependencies
```sh
yarn
```

### Step 2. Set environment variables
Set the following environment variables directly or by placing them in `.env` file of project's root.

| Variable | Description | Default |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `PORT` | Port where middleware should listen for requests | `3005` |
| `DEVICE_HOST` | IP or domain from where [`umbrel-dashboard`](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-dashboard) will request | `http://umbrel.local` |
| `BITCOIN_HOST` | IP or domain where `bitcoind` RPC is listening | `127.0.0.1` |
| `RPC_USER` | `bitcoind` RPC username  |  |
| `RPC_PASSWORD` | `bitcoind` RPC password |  |
| `LND_HOST` | IP or domain where `lnd` RPC is listening | `127.0.0.1` |
| `TLS_FILE` | Path to `lnd`'s TLS certificate | Defaults to (This is the pathname in docker): `/lnd/tls.cert` |
| `LND_PORT` | Port where `lnd` RPC is listening | `10009` |
| `LND_NETWORK` | The chain `bitcoind` is running on (mainnet, testnet, regtest, simnet) | `mainnet` |
| `MACAROON_DIR` | Path to `lnd`'s `admin.macroon` file | Defaults to (This is the pathname in docker): `/lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/` |
| `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE` | Path to the JWT public key created by [`umbrel-manager`](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-manager) | `/jwt-public-key/jwt.pem` |

### Step 3. Run middleware
```sh
yarn start
```

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Don't be too reckless

> Umbrel is still in an early stage and things are expected to break every now and then. We **DO NOT** recommend running it on the mainnet with real money just yet, unless you want to be really *#reckless*.
